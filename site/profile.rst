    Leftfield is run by myself, Dugal Harris.  I have been writing software and doing research for many years - mostly centered around the interpretation of images.  Having worked as an independent contractor since 2012, I started Leftfield in 2023 to give myself a home for focusing on geospatial applications.  Currently, I develop mainly in `python <https://www.python.org/>`_, but am also fluent in `C++ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B>`_; and have explored a number of other languages.  I have a strong foundation in remote sensing, machine learning and image processing, hold an MSc in Electronic Engineering, and a PhD in GeoInformatics.  Rheenendal, South Africa is home.
