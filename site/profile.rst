    Leftfield was started by myself, Dugal Harris.  I have been writing software and doing research for many years, mostly centered around the interpretation of images.  Skills I have include remote sensing, machine learning and image processing.  I have worked independently as a contracting software engineer since 2012.  Currently, I develop mainly in `python <https://www.python.org/>`_, but am also fluent in `C++ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B>`_; and have explored a number of other languages.  I hold an MSc in Electronic Engineering, and a PhD in GeoInformatics.  Rheenendal, South Africa is home.
