    Leftfield was started by myself, Dugal Harris.  I am an electronic engineer with a PhD in geoinformatics.  Much of my work experience has been centered on the fields of remote sensing, machine learning and image processing; spanning both research and operational projects.  Currently, I develop mainly in `python <https://www.python.org/>`_, but am also fluent in `C++ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B>`_; and have explored a number of other languages.  I am based in Rheenendal, South Africa.
