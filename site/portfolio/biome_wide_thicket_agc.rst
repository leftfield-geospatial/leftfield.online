Biome-wide aboveground carbon mapping in thicket
------------------------------------------------

As an experiment in extending the :doc:`farm-scale aboveground carbon (AGC) model <thicket_agc>` with `Google Earth Engine (GEE) <https://earthengine.google.com>`_, the univariate linear model developed in that study was re-calibrated to Landsat-8 imagery, and applied to the thicket biome.  The resulting AGC map can be browsed with the `GEE app <https://dugalh.users.earthengine.app/view/thicket-aboveground-carbon>`_ (it might take a minute to load).  The app code is available `here <https://github.com/leftfield-geospatial/extend-thicket-agc>`_.  Note that this should be regarded as a prototype - AGC estimates outside the :ref:`GEF-5 SLM study area <gef5_slm_study_area>` are unvalidated.
