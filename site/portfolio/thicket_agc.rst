Farm-scale aboveground carbon mapping in thicket
------------------------------------------------

As part of the `GEF-5 SLM (sustainable land management) project <https://www.thegef.org/projects-operations/projects/5327>`_, this work developed an aboveground carbon mapping approach for thicket in a Â±3000 ha study area in the Baviaanskloof.  Field methods were used to gather AGC ground truth for number of plots:

Various approaches for modelling AGC were evaluated using the ground truth.  Straightforward linear regression models using high resolution multispectral satellite (WorldView-3) imagery performed well. The `code repository  <https://github.com/leftfield-geospatial/map-thicket-agc>`_ and  `related paper <https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JRS.15.038502>`_ contain more details on the data, method and performance.
