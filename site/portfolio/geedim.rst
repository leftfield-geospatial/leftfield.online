Earth Engine search and download
--------------------------------

Geedim_ was developed as a companion to :doc:`Homonim <homonim>` for acquiring cloud/shadow-free reference imagery.  It is a command line toolkit and library that allows searching, compositing and downloading `Google Earth Engine <https://earthengine.google.com>`__ satellite imagery.  Cloud/shadow masking and cloud/shadow-free compositing is supported on selected image collections.  It is used for these functions outside of the Homonim context too.  The `online documentation <https://geedim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ gives more detail on its capabilities and use.
